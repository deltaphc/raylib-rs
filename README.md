# raylib-rs

raylib-rs is a Rust binding for [raylib](http://www.raylib.com/) 2.0. It currently targets the _stable_ Rust toolchain, version 1.31 or higher.

Though this binding tries to stay close to the simple C API, it makes some changes to be more idiomatic for Rust. Resources are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope (or when `std::mem::drop` is called), just like all other resources in Rust. This means that "Unload" functions are not exposed (and not necessary). Additional changes include:
- Most of the Raylib API is exposed through `RaylibHandle`, which is for enforcing that Raylib is only initialized once, and for making sure the window is closed properly.
- A `RaylibHandle` is obtained through `raylib_rs::init_window(...)` or through the newer `init()` function which will allow you to `build` up some window options before initialization (replaces `set_config_flags`).
- Manually closing the window is unnecessary, because `CloseWindow` is automatically called when `RaylibHandle` goes out of scope.
- `Model::set_material`, `Material::set_shader`, and `MaterialMap::set_texture` methods were added since one cannot set the fields directly. Also enforces correct ownership semantics.
- `Font::from_data`, `Font::set_chars`, and `Font::set_texture` methods were added to create a `Font` from loaded `CharInfo` data.
- `SubText` and `FormatText` are omitted, and are instead covered by Rust's string slicing and Rust's `format!` macro, respectively.

**Disclaimer: I created this binding as a way to learn Rust. There may be some things I can do better, or make more ergonomic for users. Feel free to make suggestions!**

# Installation

So far, I have only tested on Windows. Tips on making things work smoothly on all platforms is appreciated.

(the git path below is temporary until raylib-rs is published to crates.io)

1. Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
raylib = { git = "https://github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs" }
```

2. Download raylib 2.0 from https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/2.0.0, and pick the one that matches your Rust toolchain. MSVC with MSVC, MinGW with GNU, 32-bit or 64-bit.

3. Copy `libraylib.a` (for GCC/MinGW) or `raylib.lib` (for MSVC) to the appropriate path in your Rust toolchain.
   - For rustup/MSVC: `.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib`
   - For rustup/GNU: `.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\lib\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\lib`

4. Start coding!
```rust
fn main() {
    let rl = raylib::init()
        .size(640, 480)
        .title("Hello, World")
        .build();
    
    while !rl.window_should_close() {
        rl.begin_drawing();

        rl.clear_background(raylib::WHITE);
        rl.draw_text("Hello, world!", 12, 12, 20, raylib::BLACK);

        rl.end_drawing();
    }
}
```

# Tech Notes

- Structs holding resources have RAII/move semantics, including: `Image`, `Texture2D`, `RenderTexture2D`, `Font`, `Mesh`, `Shader`, `Material`, `Model`, `Wave`, `Sound`, `Music`, and `AudioStream`.
- Functions dealing with string data take in `&str` and/or return an owned `String`, for the sake of safety.
- In C, `LoadFontData` returns a pointer to a heap-allocated array of `CharInfo` structs. In this Rust binding, said array is copied into an owned `Vec<CharInfo>`, the original data is freed, and the owned Vec is returned.
- In C, `GetDroppedFiles` returns a pointer to an array of strings owned by raylib. Again, for safety and also ease of use, this binding copies said array into a `Vec<String>` which is returned to the caller.
- `TraceLog` functionality is actually reimplemented in Rust since the language does not have variadic functions in safe code, nor a way to unpack sequences into arguments (to my knowledge). However, since `format!` is variadic, one could use that macro in combination with `trace_log` to achieve the same effect.
- The raw FFI binding was initially generated by `bindgen` and then hand-tweaked a bit.
- I've tried to make linking automatic, though I've only tested on Windows. Other platforms may have other considerations.

# Extras

- In addition to the base library, there is also a convenient `ease` module which contains various interpolation/easing functions ported from raylib's `easings.h`, as well as a `Tween` struct to assist in using these functions.
- Equivalent math and vector operations, ported from `raymath.h`, are `impl`ed on the various Vector and Matrix types. Operator overloading is used for more intuitive design.

# Future Goals

- Port raylib examples over to Rust.
- Perhaps use Rust enums instead of consts.
- More tests.
- More platform testing.
- Even more testing.
- Physac port?
